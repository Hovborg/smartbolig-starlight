## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Does Shelly work without internet?",
    answer: "Yes! All Shelly devices work 100% locally. You can control them via local IP, MQTT, or Home Assistant - no cloud required."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Plus and Pro?",
    answer: "Plus is for mounting behind switches, Pro is for DIN rail in breaker boxes. Pro also has LAN port and longer warranty (5 years vs 3 years)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Shelly without Home Assistant?",
    answer: "Yes. Shelly app (iOS/Android) works fine alone, and you can also use Alexa, Google Home, or Apple HomeKit (via Matter on Gen4)."
  },
  {
    question: "What does Gen3 and Gen4 mean?",
    answer: "Gen3 has new 8MB chip, better performance and Matter support. Gen4 adds multi-protocol: WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee AND Matter in the same device."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Shelly BLU require a gateway?",
    answer: "Yes, for app control. But all Shelly Plus/Pro/Gen3/Gen4 devices can function as gateway - you don't need to buy a separate one."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I install Shelly myself?",
    answer: "Plugs and sensors: Yes. Relays behind switches: Only if you're comfortable with electrical work. When in doubt, use a certified electrician."
  }
