## 📹 Surveillance Cameras

### Local vs Cloud

| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Local (Reolink, Eufy)** | No subscription, privacy, fast | Requires NVR or NAS |

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Can I use smart lock without internet?",
    answer: "Yes! Nuki, Yale and SwitchBot all work via Bluetooth. You can unlock with your phone close to the door. Internet/WiFi is only needed for remote control and notifications."
  },
  {
    question: "Are Reolink cameras secure?",
    answer: "Yes, Reolink cameras work fully locally without cloud. They support RTSP/ONVIF and are Works with Home Assistant certified. Keep firmware updated for best security."
  },
  {
    question: "What about Ring and Nest - are they bad?",
    answer: "No, they are good products but require cloud subscription and send data to Amazon/Google servers. If privacy is important, choose Reolink or Eufy instead."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I build my own alarm cheaply?",
    answer: "Yes! With Zigbee door/window sensors (~$7 each), motion sensors (~$14 each) and a siren (~$21), you can build a complete alarm system for under $140."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use PoE or WiFi cameras?",
    answer: "PoE is more reliable and easier to power, but requires cabling. WiFi is easier to install but can have connection issues. Use PoE where possible."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Frigate and do I need it?",
    answer: "Frigate is an advanced NVR with AI object detection. It requires more hardware (Coral TPU) but provides better detection than cameras' built-in AI. Start without and add later."
