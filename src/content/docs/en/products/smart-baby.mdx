## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Is the Owlet sock safe to use?",
    answer: "Yes, Owlet is FDA-cleared as a consumer wellness product. It is NOT a medical device and does not replace medical supervision. Use it for extra peace of mind, not as primary monitoring for at-risk infants."
  },
  {
    question: "Nanit vs Owlet - what's the difference?",
    answer: "Nanit focuses on video and sleep tracking via camera. Owlet focuses on physiological measurements (heart rate, oxygen) via wearable sock. Many parents use both together."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Hatch Rest integrate with Home Assistant?",
    answer: "Yes! Via HACS custom integration (ha_hatch). You can control light, sound, volume and create automations based on time and other sensors."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the ideal temperature for the nursery?",
    answer: "65-72°F (18-22°C) is recommended for sleeping babies. Use a smart temperature sensor to monitor and get notifications if it gets too hot or cold."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Nanit require a subscription?",
    answer: "Nanit includes 1 year of free Insights. After that, a paid subscription is required for sleep analysis and history. Basic live video always works."
  }
