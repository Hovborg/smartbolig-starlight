Smart garage door control gives you **remote access and status** - open/close from your phone, get notifications, and automate based on presence. With the right solutions, you can avoid cloud dependency and keep control local.

<Aside type="caution" title="MyQ Warning">
**Chamberlain/LiftMaster MyQ** has blocked third-party integrations since December 2023. Home Assistant NO LONGER officially supports MyQ. Use **ratgdo** or **Konnected blaQ** for local control instead.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Top Recommendations 2025">
- **Local control (Chamberlain/LiftMaster)**: ratgdo (~$35) or Konnected blaQ (~$70)
- **Universal (all brands)**: Meross MSG100HK (~$40)
- **Premium multi-door**: ismartgate Pro (~$150)
- **DIY**: Shelly 1 + reed switch (~$20)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Does MyQ still work with Home Assistant?",
    answer: "No! Chamberlain blocked third-party access in December 2023. The official MyQ integration has been removed from HA. Use ratgdo or Konnected blaQ for local control."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between ratgdo and Konnected blaQ?",
    answer: "Both use the same technology. ratgdo is cheaper but requires self-assembly. blaQ is more expensive but pre-assembled with support. Both use ESPHome and function identically in HA."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Meross without cloud?",
    answer: "Partially. The HomeKit version can be controlled locally via HomeKit Controller in HA. With the Meross LAN HACS integration, you get full local HTTP control."
  },
  {
    question: "Which solution is best for Chamberlain/LiftMaster?",
    answer: "ratgdo or Konnected blaQ. These speak the Security+ 2.0 protocol directly and provide full functionality including obstruction sensor and light control."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I open the garage based on GPS?",
    answer: "Yes! Use Home Assistant zones and device_tracker. When your phone enters a zone, an automation can open the door. Add safety conditions like time of day."
  }
