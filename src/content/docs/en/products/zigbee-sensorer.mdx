## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What's the difference between PIR and mmWave sensors?",
    answer: "PIR sensors detect motion via infrared radiation - they cannot see stationary people. mmWave/radar sensors can detect even small movements from breathing and are perfect for places where you sit still (office, bathroom, bedroom)."
  },
  {
    question: "How long battery life can I expect?",
    answer: "Aqara and Sonoff P-series typically last 2-5 years depending on use. Sensors that trigger often (motion) use more battery than door sensors. IKEA uses AAA batteries which are easy to replace."
  },
  {
    question: "Do the sensors work without Aqara/IKEA hub?",
    answer: "Yes! All Zigbee sensors work with any Zigbee coordinator (Sonoff dongle, SLZB-06, SkyConnect etc.) via ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT in Home Assistant. You do NOT need the manufacturer's hub."
  },
  {
    question: "Which sensor for light automation?",
    answer: "For areas with walk-through traffic (hallway, stairs): Aqara Motion P1 with 1-5 sec cooldown. For living rooms/offices where you sit still: mmWave sensor (Aqara FP300 or Sonoff SNZB-06P)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use battery sensors outdoors?",
    answer: "IKEA VALLHORN has IP44 rating and can be used outdoors under cover. Other sensors are for indoor use only. For true outdoor use, consider wired solutions."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my motion sensor always show 'detected'?",
    answer: "PIR sensors have a cooldown period (typically 60 sec) where they cannot detect new motion. Aqara P1 lets you adjust this down to 1 second via Zigbee2MQTT."
  }
