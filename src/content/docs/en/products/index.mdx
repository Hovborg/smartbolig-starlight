Reviews and recommendations of smart home products tested in real homes. We focus on products that work **locally** with Home Assistant.

<Aside type="tip" title="Local First">
We recommend products that work **without cloud** when possible. This provides better privacy, faster response times, and works even if the manufacturer shuts down.
