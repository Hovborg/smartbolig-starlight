## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Dreame and Roborock?",
    answer: "Both make excellent robots. Dreame often has better price-performance and better Valetudo support. Roborock has slightly better app and more established brand. In 2025, Dreame L50 Ultra is a better buy than equivalent Roborock."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Valetudo worth it?",
    answer: "Yes, if you want local control and privacy. You don't lose functionality, and you get faster response + MQTT integration. However, it requires some technical skill to install."
  },
  {
    question: "Can robot vacuums handle pet hair?",
    answer: "Yes! Modern models with anti-tangle brushes (Dreame HyperStream, Roborock DuoDivide) handle long hair and pet hair without getting tangled."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should the robot run?",
    answer: "Most run daily on standard suction. With pets or kids, 2x daily may be needed. Weekly deep cleaning on max is recommended."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the mop work well?",
    answer: "Modern rotating mops (2024-2025 models) are surprisingly good. They don't replace thorough manual mopping, but keep floors nice daily. Spinning pads are better than vibrating pads."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy a self-emptying dock?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Auto-empty + mop wash + drying reduces maintenance to almost nothing. It's worth paying extra for."
  }
