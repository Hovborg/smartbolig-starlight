## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How many devices can a coordinator handle?",
    answer: "Most modern coordinators can handle 200+ devices directly. With router devices (bulbs, plugs) you can reach 500+ devices. For most homes, even budget coordinators are plenty."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I choose ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT?",
    answer: "For beginners: ZHA (built-in, easy). For advanced users: Zigbee2MQTT (more features, better debugging). Both work with all coordinators on this list."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my coordinator without re-pairing all devices?",
    answer: "No, unfortunately. Changing coordinators requires re-pairing all devices. Consider this before choosing - better to buy a good coordinator from the start."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Thread and Matter? Do I need it?",
    answer: "Thread is a new protocol used by Matter (Apple's/Google's smart home standard). EFR32MG21/MG24 chips support it. It's 'nice to have' for the future, but not necessary now."
  },
  {
    question: "USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 port?",
    answer: "Always use USB 2.0 port or a USB extension cable. USB 3.0 ports can cause interference with the Zigbee 2.4GHz signal."
  },
  {
    question: "PoE - what do I need?",
    answer: "You need either a PoE switch (recommended) or a PoE injector. Most SLZB-06 and Dongle Max use 802.3af (15W) which is standard. A PoE injector costs about $15-20."
  }
