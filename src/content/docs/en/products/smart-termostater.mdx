Smart heating is one of the **best investments** in smart home. With smart radiator valves (TRV) you can save **15-25% on heating bills** by heating rooms individually and only when you're home.

<Aside type="tip" title="Top Recommendations 2025">
- **Budget Zigbee TRV**: Sonoff TRVZB (~$35)
- **Premium Zigbee TRV**: Aqara E1 (~$50)
- **Complete system**: Tado, Netatmo, Drayton Wiser
- **Home Assistant**: Better Thermostat integration
- **External sensor**: Aqara temperature sensor for accurate readings

## 🔑 What Is A Smart TRV?

A **TRV (Thermostatic Radiator Valve)** is a thermostat valve that sits on your radiator. A smart TRV can:

- ✅ Be controlled from phone or Home Assistant
- ✅ Follow schedules (heat up before you wake)
- ✅ Detect open windows and turn off
- ✅ Use external temperature sensor
- ✅ Integrate into automations

### Smart TRV vs Complete System

| Zigbee TRV (DIY) | Complete System (Tado/Netatmo) |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| ✅ Cheaper per unit | ✅ Plug-and-play setup |
| ✅ Full control via Home Assistant | ✅ Nice app for the whole family |
| ✅ No cloud dependency | ✅ Geofencing built-in |
| ✅ Mix different brands | ✅ Support and warranty |
| ❌ Requires more setup | ❌ More expensive |
| ❌ No official support | ❌ Cloud-dependent (most) |
| ❌ Cannot call for heat* | ❌ Locked to one ecosystem |

*Most TRVs can only open/close the valve - they cannot turn on the boiler. You need a separate thermostat or relay for that.

## 💰 Budget: Moes/Tuya TRV

**Price:** ~$25-28

Moes and other Tuya-based TRVs are the **cheapest**, but with compromises:

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| ✅ Very cheap | ❌ Lower build quality |
| ✅ Works with Z2M | ❌ Touch interface (impractical) |
| ✅ Many adapters | ❌ Display hard to see |
| | ❌ Inconsistent quality |
| | ❌ Full open on low battery! |

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning: Moes on low battery">
Some Moes TRVs open the valve **fully** when battery is low. This can lead to overheating and higher heating bills. Change batteries proactively!

## 🧠 Better Thermostat Integration

**Better Thermostat** is a HACS integration that makes your "dumb" TRVs smart:

### Features

- ✅ Uses external temperature sensor (not TRV's inaccurate sensor)
- ✅ Window/door sensors (turn off when open)
- ✅ Weather forecast integration
- ✅ Group multiple TRVs per room
- ✅ Improved algorithm for energy savings

### Installation

1. **HACS** → Search "Better Thermostat"
2. **Install** and restart
3. **Add integration** → Better Thermostat
4. **Configure**:
   - Select your TRV climate entity
   - Select external temperature sensor
   - Add window/door sensors

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# configuration.yaml or via UI
climate:
  - platform: better_thermostat
    name: "Living Room Heat"
    thermostat: climate.living_room_radiator_trv
    temperature_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature
    window_sensors:
      - binary_sensor.living_room_window
    outdoor_sensor: sensor.outdoor_temperature
```

## ⚡ Calling For Heat

Most Zigbee TRVs can **only** open/close the valve. They cannot turn on your boiler.

### Solutions

**1. Existing thermostat:**
Keep your normal thermostat and let it call for heat. The TRVs only control local temperature.

**2. Smart relay:**
Use a Shelly 1 or similar to turn the boiler on/off based on whether any TRV needs heat.

**3. OpenTherm:**
If you have a modulating boiler, an OpenTherm gateway (e.g., OTGW) can provide precise control.

### Home Assistant Automation

```yaml
# Turn on boiler when a TRV calls for heat
automation:
  - alias: "Boiler on/off"
    trigger:
      - platform: template
        value_template: >
          {{ states.climate 
             | selectattr('attributes.hvac_action', 'eq', 'heating')
             | list | count > 0 }}
    action:
      - choose:
          - conditions: "{{ trigger.to_state.state == 'True' }}"
            sequence:
              - service: switch.turn_on
                entity_id: switch.boiler_relay
          - conditions: "{{ trigger.to_state.state == 'False' }}"
            sequence:
              - service: switch.turn_off
                entity_id: switch.boiler_relay
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Does smart TRV work with district heating?",
    answer: "Yes! District heating works exactly like regular central heating. The TRV just controls how much hot water flows through the radiator. You don't need to change anything about your district heating system."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I mix different TRV brands?",
    answer: "Yes, with Home Assistant and Zigbee2MQTT/ZHA you can freely mix Sonoff, Aqara, Moes, etc. Better Thermostat integration helps unify them."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save?",
    answer: "Typically 15-25% on heating bills. Savings come from: 1) Only heating when you're home, 2) Lower temperature in unused rooms, 3) Automatic off on open windows, 4) Night temperature reduction."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an external temperature sensor?",
    answer: "Recommended! The TRV's built-in sensor sits close to the radiator and often measures 2-4°C too high. An external sensor (Aqara, Sonoff) gives much more accurate temperature control."
  },
  {
    question: "What about underfloor heating?",
    answer: "Underfloor heating is typically controlled by a separate thermostat, not TRV. See our guide to underfloor heating controllers. You can still integrate these with Home Assistant."
  },
  {
    question: "Do batteries last all winter?",
    answer: "Most TRVs last 6-12 months on a set of AA batteries with normal use. Sonoff and Aqara are among the most energy efficient."
  }
