## 🔍 What are Thread and Matter?

### Thread - The Network Protocol

| Feature | Thread | Zigbee | WiFi |
|---------|--------|--------|------|
| **Type** | Mesh network | Mesh network | Star network |
| **Frequency** | 2.4 GHz (802.15.4) | 2.4 GHz (802.15.4) | 2.4/5 GHz |
| **Power consumption** | Ultra-low | Low | High |
| **IP-based** | ✅ IPv6 | ❌ | ✅ IPv4/IPv6 |
| **Border Router** | Required | Coordinator | Router |
| **Multi-admin** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Thread is NOT a control protocol** - it only defines how devices communicate. You need Matter or HomeKit on top of Thread to control devices.

### Matter - The Control Protocol

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            MATTER CONTROLLER            │
│         (Home Assistant, Google,        │

└─────────────┬───────────────┬───────────┘
              │               │
      ┌───────▼───────┐ ┌─────▼─────┐

      └───────┬───────┘ └─────┬─────┘
              │               │

      │  Switches)    │ │           │
      └───────────────┘ └───────────┘
```

**Matter advantages:**
- ✅ Multi-controller (use same device with HA + Google + Apple)
- ✅ Local communication (no cloud required)
- ✅ Industry standard (500+ companies)
- ✅ Certified interoperability

   - Thread integration → Check status

2. **Factory reset the device:**
   - See device manual
   - Typically: Hold button 10+ seconds

3. **Move closer:**
   - Phone close to border router
   - Device close to border router

4. **Check WiFi (for WiFi Matter):**
   - Must be 2.4 GHz
   - Same network as HA

5. **Restart:**

- Move border router centrally
- Check Thread network map in HA
```

### Matter Server Logs

```bash
# In Home Assistant:
# Settings → System → Logs → Select "Matter Server"

## 📊 Thread vs Zigbee vs Z-Wave

| Feature | Thread/Matter | Zigbee | Z-Wave |
|---------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **IP-native** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Multi-controller** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Standard** | Open | Open | Closed |
| **Battery life** | Excellent | Good | Good |
| **Mesh routing** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Maturity** | New (2022+) | Mature | Mature |
| **Device count** | Many | Most | Moderate |
| **Price** | Moderate | Low | High |

<Aside type="tip" title="When to Choose What?">
**Choose Matter/Thread if:**
- You want to use devices with multiple systems
- You're starting from scratch
- You prioritize future-proofing

**Stay with Zigbee/Z-Wave if:**

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Can I use Matter without Thread?",
    answer: "Yes! Matter also works over WiFi. You only need a Thread border router for Thread-based Matter devices (typically battery-powered sensors)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the same device with Google, Apple AND Home Assistant?",
    answer: "Yes, that's Matter's big advantage! You can add up to 5 controllers to the same device. The device is controlled locally by all controllers independently."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I switch from Zigbee to Matter?",
    answer: "No, not necessarily. Zigbee is mature and has more devices. Matter is the future but still under development. You can easily run both in parallel."
  },
  {
    question: "Why doesn't my iPhone work with HA as border router?",
    answer: "There's a known bug. iOS requires Apple border router (HomePod/Apple TV) for Thread commissioning. Android works with HA's OpenThread Border Router."
  }
