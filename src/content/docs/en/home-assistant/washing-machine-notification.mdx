Never forget the laundry again! This guide shows how to get a notification on your phone (or via speaker) when the washing machine is done - based on power consumption.

![Washing machine automation overview](/images/guides/vaskemaskine-notification/overview.svg)

## 🤔 How Does It Work?

Washing machines use a lot of power during washing (500-2000W) and almost none when finished (0-5W). By measuring power consumption we can detect:

| State | Power Usage | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Off** | 0W | Machine is off |
| **Standby** | 1-5W | On but not active |
| **Running** | 100-2000W | Active wash/spin |
| **Done** | 1-5W (after high) | Was high, now low = done! |

<Aside type="tip" title="Simple principle">
When power consumption drops from high (over 10W) to low (under 5W) for more than 3 minutes = washing machine is done!
</Aside>

## 📦 What You Need

| Component | Examples | Price |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Smart plug with power monitoring** | Shelly Plug S, NOUS A1T, TP-Link KP115 | $20-35 |

<Aside type="caution" title="Important: Capacity!">
Washing machines can draw up to **2500W**. Make sure your smart plug is rated for at least **16A / 3680W**!
</Aside>

### Recommended Smart Plugs

| Model | Max W | Protocol | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Shelly Plug S** | 2500W | WiFi | ✅ Local, reliable |
| **NOUS A1T** | 3680W | Zigbee | ✅ Good price, Zigbee |
| **TP-Link KP115** | 1800W | WiFi | ⚠️ Maybe too low capacity |

## 🔧 Setup

### Step 1: Connect Smart Plug

<Steps>
1. Plug smart plug into outlet
2. Connect washing machine to smart plug
3. Add plug to Home Assistant
4. Verify you have a **power sensor** (W)
</Steps>

### Step 2: Find Your Values

Run a wash and observe power consumption in Home Assistant.

**Typical values:**
```
Standby:        ~2W
Filling:        ~50W
Washing:        ~200-500W
Spinning:       ~300-600W
Done:           ~2W
```

### Step 3: Create Helper (Optional but Recommended)

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & services** → **Helpers**
2. Click **Create helper** → **Dropdown**
3. **Name**: "Washing Machine Status"
4. **Options**: `off`, `running`, `done`, `emptied`
</Steps>

## 🤖 Automation: Basic Notification

### Simple Version (Recommended Start)

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Washing machine done notification"
    description: "Send message when washing machine is done"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.washing_machine_power
        below: 5
        for:
          minutes: 3
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_select.washing_machine_status
        state: "running"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "🧺 Washing Machine"
          message: "The laundry is done!"
          data:
            tag: "washing_machine"
```

### Better Version with Status Tracking

```yaml
automation:
  # When machine starts
  - alias: "Washing Machine: Started"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.washing_machine_power
        above: 10
        for:
          minutes: 1
    action:
      - service: input_select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: input_select.washing_machine_status
        data:
          option: "running"

  # When machine is done
  - alias: "Washing Machine: Done"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.washing_machine_power
        below: 5
        for:
          minutes: 3
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_select.washing_machine_status
        state: "running"
    action:
      - service: input_select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: input_select.washing_machine_status
        data:
          option: "done"
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "🧺 Washing Machine"
          message: "The laundry is done! Remember to empty the machine."
          data:
            tag: "washing_machine"
            persistent: true
            actions:
              - action: "WASHING_EMPTIED"
                title: "✓ Emptied"
```

## 📢 Advanced: Repeated Reminders

If you (like most people) ignore the first notification:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Washing Machine: Repeat reminder"
    trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        minutes: "/15"  # Every 15 minutes
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_select.washing_machine_status
        state: "done"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "🧺 Washing Machine - REMINDER"
          message: "The laundry is still waiting!"
          data:
            tag: "washing_machine"
```

## 🔊 TTS Announcement (Google Home / Sonos)

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Washing Machine: TTS announcement"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.washing_machine_power
        below: 5
        for:
          minutes: 3
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_select.washing_machine_status
        state: "running"
    action:
      - service: input_select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: input_select.washing_machine_status
        data:
          option: "done"
      - service: tts.google_translate_say
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
        data:
          message: "The washing machine is done. Remember to empty it."
```

## 📊 Dashboard Card

```yaml
type: entities
title: Washing Machine
entities:
  - entity: input_select.washing_machine_status
    name: Status
  - entity: sensor.washing_machine_power
    name: Power Usage
  - entity: sensor.washing_machine_energy_today
    name: Usage Today
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<Aside type="tip" title="Notification comes too early?">
Washing machines can pause during wash. Increase `for` time to 5-10 minutes.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Notification doesn't come?">
1. Check that power sensor updates (may be delayed)
2. Verify trigger value (5W) matches your machine
3. Check condition - maybe status isn't "running"
</Aside>

## 🔄 Also Works For

Same principle can be used for:

| Appliance | Start threshold | End threshold |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Dryer** | Over 50W | Under 10W |
| **Dishwasher** | Over 10W | Under 5W |
| **Oven** | Over 100W | Under 10W |
| **3D printer** | Over 50W | Under 10W |
