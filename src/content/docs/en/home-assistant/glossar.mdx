A complete dictionary of all the terms, abbreviations and technologies you'll encounter in the smart home world.

---

## A

### Automation
A rule that automatically performs actions based on triggers and conditions. E.g., "Turn on lights when motion is detected".

### API (Application Programming Interface)
Interface that allows software to communicate with each other. Home Assistant uses APIs to control devices.

### Add-on
Extension for Home Assistant that runs in a separate container. Examples: Zigbee2MQTT, Node-RED, MariaDB.

---

## B

### Binding
In Zigbee: direct connection between two devices without a hub. E.g., a switch bound to a bulb.

### Blueprint
Pre-defined automation template in Home Assistant that can be customized with your own devices.

### Border Router
Device that connects a Thread network to your IP network. Required for Matter devices on Thread.

### Bridge
Device that translates between different protocols. E.g., Hue Bridge (Zigbee to WiFi).

---

## C

### CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)
Lightweight protocol used by Shelly devices for local communication.

### Coordinator
The central device in a Zigbee network. Manages the network and keeps track of all devices.

### Condition
Requirement in an automation that must be met before actions execute. E.g., "only if sun is down".

### Custom Component
Third-party integration for Home Assistant, often installed via HACS.

---

## D

### Dashboard
User interface in Home Assistant showing status and controls. Also called Lovelace.

### Device Class
Categorization of entities in Home Assistant. E.g., "motion" for motion sensors.

### Docker
Container technology that isolates software. Home Assistant Container runs in Docker.

### Domain
Category of entities in Home Assistant. E.g., `light`, `switch`, `sensor`, `climate`.

---

## E

### End Device
In Zigbee: battery-powered device that only communicates with its parent (router or coordinator).

### Entity
Representation of a device or sensor in Home Assistant. Has a unique ID like `sensor.living_room_temperature`.

### ESPHome
Firmware platform for ESP32/ESP8266 that generates YAML-based configuration.

### Event
Occurrence in Home Assistant that can be used as a trigger. E.g., "state_changed" or "call_service".

---

## F

### Firmware
Software running at hardware level in devices. Can often be updated OTA.

### Flow
In Node-RED: collection of nodes that form an automation.

---

## G

### GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
Physical pins on microcontrollers (ESP32, Raspberry Pi) for connecting sensors and actuators.

### Group
Collection of entities that can be controlled as one. E.g., all lights in the living room.

---

## H

### HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
Unofficial integration store for Home Assistant with custom components and frontend cards.

### HAOS (Home Assistant Operating System)
Dedicated operating system optimized for running Home Assistant.

### Helper
Virtual entity in Home Assistant. E.g., input_boolean, input_number, timer.

### Hub
Central device that connects and controls smart home devices. Home Assistant is a hub.

---

## I

### Integration
Component in Home Assistant that connects to external services or devices.

### IoT (Internet of Things)
Collective term for internet-connected devices - the foundation of smart home.

---

## J

### Jinja2
Template language used in Home Assistant for dynamic content and calculations.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Data format used for configuration and API communication.

---

## L

### Lambda
In ESPHome: C++ code block for advanced logic.

### LAN (Local Area Network)
Local network in the home. Many smart home devices only communicate on LAN.

### Lovelace
Home Assistant's dashboard system. Named after Ada Lovelace.

### LQI (Link Quality Indicator)
Measurement of signal quality in Zigbee networks. Higher is better.

---

## M

### Matter
New smart home standard ensuring interoperability between manufacturers. Uses Thread or WiFi.

### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
Lightweight messaging protocol widely used in smart home. Zigbee2MQTT uses MQTT.

### Mesh Network
Network where devices relay messages. Zigbee and Z-Wave use mesh.

### mmWave
Millimeter wave radar used in presence sensors. Can detect stationary people.

---

## N

### Node
In Node-RED: building block that performs a function. Can be trigger, condition, or action.

### Node-RED
Visual programming tool for automations. Popular supplement to HA automations.

---

## O

### OTA (Over-The-Air)
Wireless firmware update. Most smart home devices support OTA.

---

## P

### PIR (Passive Infrared)
Technology in motion sensors that detects heat radiation from bodies.

### Polling
Technique where the system regularly queries devices for status. Opposite of push.

### Proxmox
Virtualization platform popular for running Home Assistant as a VM.

### Push
When devices send status updates themselves. More efficient than polling.

---

## R

### Recorder
Home Assistant component that stores history in a database.

### Router
In Zigbee: powered device that relays messages and extends the network.

### RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)
Measurement of WiFi or Zigbee signal strength. Lower (less negative) is better.

---

## S

### Scene
Pre-defined state for multiple devices. E.g., "Movie" that dims lights and turns on TV.

### Script
Sequence of actions in Home Assistant that can be called as a service.

### Service
Function that can be called in Home Assistant. E.g., `light.turn_on`.

### State
Current condition of an entity. E.g., "on", "off", "25.5".

### Supervisor
Component in HAOS that manages add-ons and system functions.

---

## T

### Tasmota
Open source firmware for ESP8266/ESP32 devices. Popular alternative to factory firmware.

### Template
Dynamic text in Home Assistant using Jinja2 for calculations.

### Thread
Low-energy mesh network protocol. Used by Matter devices as alternative to WiFi.

### Trigger
Event that starts an automation. E.g., motion detected, time reached, state changed.

---

## U

### UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
Unique ID used to identify devices and entities.

---

## V

### VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
Virtually separated network. Recommended for isolating IoT devices.

### VM (Virtual Machine)
Virtual computer running on physical hardware. Proxmox can run HA in a VM.

---

## W

### Webhook
URL that receives data from external services. Used for integrations.

### WebSocket
Two-way communication protocol. Home Assistant frontend uses WebSocket.

---

## Y

### YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
Configuration format used in Home Assistant and ESPHome.

---

## Z

### Z-Wave
Wireless protocol for smart home devices. Competitor to Zigbee, requires separate coordinator.

### ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation)
Native Zigbee integration in Home Assistant.

### Zigbee
Wireless mesh protocol popular for sensors and actuators. Requires coordinator.

### Zigbee2MQTT
Add-on that connects Zigbee devices to Home Assistant via MQTT.
