Raspberry Pi is the most popular way to run Home Assistant. Cheap, silent, and uses only 5-10W of power.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+) or Pi 5
- ✅ Computer to flash SD card
- ✅ Network with internet access

## 🛒 Hardware

| Part | Description | Price |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) | Recommended model | ~$55 |
| Power supply | Official 15W USB-C | ~$15 |
| SD card 32GB+ | Samsung EVO or SanDisk | ~$10 |
| Ethernet cable | Cat5e/Cat6 | ~$5 |
| **Total** | | **~$85** |

### Optional (but recommended)

| Part | Why | Price |
|------|-----|-------|
| SSD + USB adapter | Faster, lasts longer | ~$30 |
| Heatsink/fan | Keeps Pi cool | ~$10 |
| Case | Protection and aesthetics | ~$15 |

<Aside type="caution" title="⚠️ SD cards don't last forever">
SD cards die after 1-3 years with Home Assistant. Use SSD from the start if possible, or always have a backup ready.
</Aside>

## 📥 Download and Flash

<Steps>
1. **Download Raspberry Pi Imager**
   
   Get it from [raspberrypi.com/software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

2. **Insert SD card into computer**

3. **Open Raspberry Pi Imager**

4. **Choose operating system:**
   - Click **"Choose OS"**
   - Scroll down to **"Other specific-purpose OS"**
   - Select **"Home assistants and home automation"**
   - Select **"Home Assistant"**
   - Select **"Home Assistant OS X.X (RPi 4/5)"**

5. **Select your SD card:**
   - Click **"Choose Storage"**
   - Select your SD card (be careful - choose the right one!)

6. **Flash:**
   - Click **"Write"**
   - Confirm data will be erased
   - Wait 5-10 minutes
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
You do NOT need to configure WiFi or SSH in Imager. Home Assistant OS handles everything itself.
</Aside>

## 🔌 Hardware Setup

<Steps>
1. **Insert SD card into Raspberry Pi**
   
   The card slot is on the bottom of the board.

2. **Connect Ethernet cable**
   
   Direct to your router for most stable connection.

3. **Connect power (last!)**
   
   Use the official power supply. Cheap chargers can cause problems.
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
First boot takes **10-20 minutes**. Do NOT turn off power while waiting!
</Aside>

## 🌐 Open Home Assistant

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Automatic (easiest)">
    Open your browser and go to:
    
    ```
    http://homeassistant.local:8123
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Via IP address">
    If `homeassistant.local` doesn't work:
    
    1. Find Pi's IP in your router (often under "DHCP clients" or "Connected devices")
    2. Open: `http://192.168.X.XXX:8123`
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll first see **"Preparing Home Assistant"** - wait 10-20 minutes.

## ⚙️ First Setup

<Steps>
1. **Create your account**
   
   - Choose a username
   - Use a **strong password** (save it in a password manager!)

2. **Name your home**
   
   E.g., "My Home" or your address.

3. **Set location**
   
   Used for sunrise/sunset, weather, and timezone.

4. **Choose what to share**
   
   Anonymous statistics - completely voluntary.

5. **Discovered devices**
   
   Home Assistant automatically finds devices on your network. Click "Finish" for now.
</Steps>

🎉 **Congratulations!** Home Assistant is now running.

## 🛡️ Important First Steps

### 1. Create backup

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Backups**
2. Click **"Create backup"**
3. Download the backup file to your computer
</Steps>

<Aside type="danger">
NEVER store backups only on the SD card. If the card dies, you lose everything!
</Aside>

### 2. Update Home Assistant

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Updates**
2. Update everything available
3. Restart if necessary
</Steps>

### 3. Install useful add-ons

Go to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on store**:

| Add-on | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **File Editor** | Edit config files in browser |
| **Terminal & SSH** | Command line access |
| **Samba share** | Access files from Windows/Mac |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<Aside type="tip" title="homeassistant.local doesn't work?">
**Try these things:**
1. Wait 5 more minutes and try again
2. Find IP in your router and use `http://IP:8123`
3. Try a different browser
4. Check that Pi has green light (power) and blinking light (activity)
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="'Preparing Home Assistant' takes forever?">
**Normal time:** 10-20 minutes on first boot.

**If it takes longer:**
- Wait up to 30 minutes
- Check that Pi has internet (ethernet cable connected?)
- Try restarting by unplugging and replugging power
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Pi is getting very hot?">
Raspberry Pi 4/5 can reach 70-80°C under load.

**Solution:**
- Mount heatsink (passive cooling)
- Use case with fan (active cooling)
- Check temperature in HA under **Settings** → **System** → **Hardware**
</Aside>

## 💾 Upgrade to SSD (recommended)

SD cards are the #1 cause of Home Assistant problems. An SSD costs ~$30 and lasts many years.

### What you need

- USB 3.0 to SATA adapter or SSD enclosure
- 2.5" SATA SSD (120GB is plenty)

### How to do it

<Steps>
1. Flash Home Assistant OS to SSD (same method as SD card)
2. Turn off Pi
3. Remove SD card
4. Connect SSD via USB 3.0 port (blue port)
5. Turn on Pi
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 can boot directly from USB. No SD card needed!
</Aside>
