**Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)** is a custom integration that gives you access to thousands of community-developed integrations, themes, and Lovelace cards. HACS is almost a must-have for all Home Assistant users.

<Aside type="tip">
HACS is not an official Home Assistant add-on, but a community project that runs directly in Home Assistant. Always create a backup before installation!
</Aside>

## What is HACS?

HACS works as an "app store" for Home Assistant, where you can:

- **Discover** new custom integrations and components
- **Install** with just a few clicks directly from the UI
- **Update** everything from one place
- **Manage** your installed add-ons

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need:

- ✅ Home Assistant running (OS, Supervised, Container or Core)
- ✅ A free [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
- ✅ Access to Home Assistant web interface
- ✅ A backup of your system

<Aside type="caution">
HACS installs custom components that run directly in Home Assistant. There's always a small risk that something can go wrong - always create a backup first!
</Aside>

## Installation

The installation method depends on your Home Assistant installation type. You can see your type under **Settings → About**.

### Container/Core Installation

```

Then restart Home Assistant and continue from step 6 above.

## Troubleshooting

### HACS doesn't show after installation

- Make sure you've restarted Home Assistant
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check that HACS files are in `custom_components/hacs/`

### GitHub API limit

HACS uses the GitHub API, which has limitations. If you get errors:

- Wait 1 hour and try again
- Make sure your GitHub account is properly connected

### Integration doesn't work after download

1. Check that you've restarted Home Assistant
2. Check the log under **Settings → System → Logs**
3. Read the integration's documentation on GitHub
4. Search for solutions in Home Assistant Community forum

<FAQ
  questions={[
    {
      question: "Is HACS safe to use?",
      answer: "HACS is a community project with over 5,000 stars on GitHub. However, individual integrations are not officially approved by the Home Assistant team, so always read the documentation and reviews before installation."
    },
    {
      question: "Can HACS break my Home Assistant installation?",
      answer: "There's always a small risk with custom components. Always create a backup before installing new integrations, and only install from well-known repositories with active maintenance."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do I need a GitHub account?",
      answer: "HACS fetches all components from GitHub. A free GitHub account gives you access to more API calls and better speed."
    },

      question: "How do I remove a HACS integration?",
      answer: "Go to HACS → find the integration → click on it → click the three dots → Remove → Restart Home Assistant."
    },
    {
      question: "Does HACS work with all Home Assistant installation types?",
      answer: "Yes, HACS works with Home Assistant OS, Supervised, Container and Core. However, the installation method varies - OS/Supervised use the add-on method, while Container/Core use the script method."
