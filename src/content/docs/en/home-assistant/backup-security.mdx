## 🎯 The 3-2-1 Backup Rule

The golden standard for backup:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    3-2-1 BACKUP RULE                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  3️⃣  THREE copies of your data                              │
│      (production + 2 backups)                               │
│                                                             │
│  2️⃣  TWO different media types                              │
│      (local disk + cloud/NAS)                               │
│                                                             │
│  1️⃣  ONE copy off-site                                      │
│      (outside your home)                                    │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Why off-site?">
What if lightning strikes and destroys both your HA server AND your NAS? With an off-site backup (cloud), you're still covered.

## 🔐 Encryption

### When to Encrypt?

| Location | Recommendation | Reason |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Cloud** | ✅ Always | Data leaves your network |
| **Home Assistant Cloud** | 🔒 Automatic | Cannot be disabled |
| **NAS (home)** | ⚖️ Optional | Easier recovery without |
| **USB disk** | ✅ Yes | Can be lost/stolen |

### Encryption Key Management

```yaml
# STORE IN THESE PLACES:
1. Password Manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
2. Physical copy in safe/safety deposit box
3. Shared with a trusted person

# DON'T STORE:
- In Home Assistant itself (lost on crash)
- In unencrypted file on NAS
- Only in your head
```

---

## 📅 Backup Strategy

### Recommended Setup

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Location |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Daily** | Every night at 4:00 AM | 3 copies | Local |
| **Weekly** | Sunday at 4:00 AM | 4 copies | NAS + Cloud |
| **Before update** | On every HA update | 3 copies | All locations |

### Configure Differentiated Backups

```yaml
# Automatic backup configuration
# Settings → System → Backups → Automatic backup

Schedule:
  Frequency: Daily
  Time: 04:00
  Day: Every day

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Network Security

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Separate VLAN** | IoT devices in own network |
| **Firewall** | Block unnecessary traffic |
| **No port forwarding** | Use VPN or Nabu Casa |
| **HTTPS** | SSL/TLS on all traffic |

### Home Assistant Security

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
http:
  ssl_certificate: /ssl/fullchain.pem
  ssl_key: /ssl/privkey.pem
  ip_ban_enabled: true
  login_attempts_threshold: 5
```

### User Security

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Strong passwords** | 16+ characters, password manager |
| **2FA** | Enable for all users |
| **Least privilege** | Grant only necessary permissions |
| **Separate accounts** | One per household member, admin separate |

### Enable 2FA

<Steps>
1. Go to your **Profile picture** (bottom left)

2. Scroll to **Multifactor Authentication Modules**

3. Enable **Time-based One-Time Password**

4. Scan QR code with authenticator app:
   - Google Authenticator
   - Authy
   - 1Password

5. Enter code to confirm
</Steps>

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backup Fails

```yaml
# Check:
1. Is there enough space on destination disk?
2. Is network connection stable (NAS)?
3. Are credentials correct (cloud/NAS)?
4. Check Supervisor logs for details
```

### Restoration Fails

```yaml
# Check:
1. Is backup corrupted? (try another backup)
2. Is encryption key correct?
3. Is HA version compatible?
4. Do you have enough disk space?
```

### NAS Mount Fails

```yaml
# Common problems:
1. SMB version mismatch → Try SMB 2.0 or 3.0
2. Wrong credentials → Check username/password
3. Share doesn't exist → Check share name on NAS
4. Firewall blocks → Port 445 (SMB) must be open
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How often should I backup?",
    answer: "Minimum weekly, preferably daily. With the new automatic backup system, there's no reason not to run daily backups. Also remember backup before updates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I restore on different hardware?",
    answer: "Yes! Home Assistant backups are cross-platform and work across CPU architectures. You can go from Raspberry Pi to Intel NUC without problems."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in a backup?",
    answer: "Everything! Configuration, automations, dashboards, add-ons and their data, integrations, history (if selected). The only thing not included is Home Assistant OS itself."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use encryption on local backup?",
    answer: "It's optional for local/NAS backups. The advantage of unencrypted backups is that you can manually extract files without Home Assistant. Cloud backups should always be encrypted."
  }
