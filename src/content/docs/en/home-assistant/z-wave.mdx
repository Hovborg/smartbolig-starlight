Z-Wave is a **reliable wireless protocol** for smart home with excellent range and mesh networking. This guide covers everything from coordinator selection to advanced network setup!

<Aside type="tip" title="Z-Wave vs Zigbee">
**Z-Wave advantages:**
- Fewer devices = less interference
- Better interoperability (certification required)
- Longer range per hop
- Long Range (up to 1 mile with 800 series)

**Zigbee advantages:**
- More manufacturers and devices
- Generally cheaper
- Faster update frequency
</Aside>

## 🔌 Coordinator Selection

### Recommended USB Sticks

| Coordinator | Series | Long Range | Price | Note |
|-------------|--------|------------|-------|------|
| **Zooz ZST39** | 800 | ✅ (US only) | ~$35 | Best value, reliable |
| **Aeotec Z-Stick 7** | 700 | ❌ | ~$45 | Well-known, stable |
| **Aeotec Z-Stick 10 Pro** | 800 | ✅ | ~$60 | Dual: Z-Wave + Zigbee |
| **Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2** | 800 | ✅ | ~$30 | Official HA hardware |
| **HomeSeer SmartStick G8** | 800 | ✅ | ~$50 | Good support |

<Aside type="caution" title="Z-Wave Long Range">
**Long Range** is only available in **US/CA/MX** due to frequency regulations. In Europe (868 MHz) you still get the benefits of the 800 series: better range, lower power consumption, and S2 security.
</Aside>

### GPIO Modules (for Raspberry Pi)

| Module | Series | Price | Note |
|--------|--------|-------|------|
| **Zooz ZAC93** | 800 | ~$30 | For HA Yellow/Pi |
| **RaZberry 7 Pro** | 700 | ~$50 | GPIO header |

## 📦 Installation

### Z-Wave JS Add-on (Recommended for Beginners)

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**

2. Search for **Z-Wave JS** and install

3. Find your USB stick:
   - **Settings → System → Hardware → ⋮ → All Hardware**
   - Use the `/dev/serial/by-id/...` path (stable)

4. Configure the add-on:
   ```yaml
   device: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_...
   ```

5. Start the add-on and check logs

## 🔐 Security Keys

### S2 Security Classes

| Class | Use | Devices |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **S2 Access Control** | Highest security | Door locks, garage doors |
| **S2 Authenticated** | High security | Thermostats, alarms |
| **S2 Unauthenticated** | Basic security | Sensors, switches |
| **S0 Legacy** | Old protocol | Older devices |

### Generate Secure Keys

```bash
# Generate 16-byte hex key (32 characters)
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'A-F0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Save Your Keys!">
**IMPORTANT:** Backup your security keys! Without them you cannot communicate with secure devices if you reinstall.

Store them securely (e.g., password manager).
</Aside>

## ➕ Add Devices

### Standard Inclusion

<Steps>
1. Open Z-Wave JS UI or HA integration

2. Click **Add Device** / **Inclusion**

3. Choose security level:
   - **Default** (recommended)
   - **S2** for maximum security
   - **No Security** for testing

4. Put device in inclusion mode (see manual)
   - Typically: Press button 1x

5. Wait for interview (can take minutes)

6. Name the device
</Steps>

### SmartStart (QR Code)

2. Go to **Add Device → SmartStart**

3. Scan QR code or enter DSK

4. Device is added automatically when powered on
</Steps>

### Exclusion (Remove Device)

```yaml
# Important: Exclude devices BEFORE adding them
# to a new network - even if never added before!
```

<Steps>
1. Click **Remove Device** / **Exclusion**

2. Put device in exclusion mode (see manual)

3. Wait for confirmation
</Steps>

## 🌐 Network Optimization

### Mesh Network Basics

| Device Type | Function | Examples |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Controller** | Network center | USB stick |
| **Router** | Extends mesh | Dimmers, switches (powered) |
| **End Device** | Cannot route | Battery sensors |

### Placement Tips

```
Optimal:
┌────────────────────────────┐
│         [Router]           │
│            │               │
│ [Router]──[Controller]──[Router] │
│            │               │
│         [Router]           │
└────────────────────────────┘

Avoid:
- Controller in corner
- Long chains without routers
- Devices behind metal/water
```

### Heal Network / Rebuild Routes

```bash
# Only when necessary:
# - After moving devices
# - For persistent problems

# NOT regularly - generates lots of traffic
```

In Z-Wave JS UI: **Settings → Rebuild Routes**

---

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Device Configuration

```yaml
# In Z-Wave JS UI you can change:
# - Wake-up interval (battery sensors)
# - Report intervals
# - LED indicator
# - Association groups
```

### Association Groups

Allow direct communication between devices:

```yaml
# Example: Switch controls lamp directly
# Group 2 (Basic Set) → Lamp node ID

# Advantages:
# - Works without controller
# - Ultra-fast response
# - Reliable

# Disadvantages:
# - Hard to manage
# - No HA automation
```

### Firmware Update

```yaml
# Z-Wave JS UI → Device → Firmware Update
# Upload .otz or .hex file from manufacturer
# IMPORTANT: Only use official firmware!
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Device Not Responding

<Steps>
1. Check **Node Statistics** in Z-Wave JS UI
   - RTT (round-trip time) over 1000ms = problem

2. **Ping** the device to test connection

3. **Re-interview** the device:
   - Device → Re-interview

4. Check battery level (for battery-powered)

5. Consider adding router between device and controller
</Steps>

### Dead Nodes

```yaml
# Symptoms:
# - Device marked as "Dead"
# - No response

# Solutions:
1. Wait 24 hours (may wake up)
2. Press device physically
3. Remove Failed Node (if permanently dead)
```

### Network Map

In Z-Wave JS UI: **Network → Map**

Shows:
- All devices and connections
- Signal strength
- Routing paths

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Should I choose Z-Wave JS or Z-Wave JS UI?",
    answer: "Z-Wave JS is simpler and integrated directly into HA. Z-Wave JS UI provides more control, MQTT support, and better debugging. For most users, Z-Wave JS is enough."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I migrate from 500/700 series to 800 series?",
    answer: "Yes! You can backup/restore the network via Z-Wave JS UI. However, it requires specific firmware version (7.19.0+). Check documentation for your new stick."
  },
  {
    question: "Why don't I see all entities?",
    answer: "Wait for the interview to complete (can take several minutes). If still missing: Re-interview the device. Some devices require wake-up first (press button)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Z-Wave Long Range worth waiting for in Europe?",
    answer: "No, Long Range is only US/CA/MX due to frequency regulations. But the 800 series still has better range, lower power consumption, and latest security in Europe."
  }
