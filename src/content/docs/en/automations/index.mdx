## 🧠 How Automations Work

All automations have three parts:

```
TRIGGER  →  CONDITION  →  ACTION
(When?)      (If?)        (What?)
```

| Part | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Trigger** | What starts the automation | Sunset, motion, time, temperature |
| **Condition** | What must be true | Is anyone home? Is it dark? |
| **Action** | What happens | Turn on lights, send message, play music |

## 📚 Automation Ideas

### 🏠 Daily Use

| Automation | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Lights at sunset | Sun goes down | Turn on living room lights |
| Good morning routine | 7:00 AM on weekdays | Turn on lights, start coffee |
| Welcome home | Person arrives | Turn on lights, unlock door |
| Good night | 11:00 PM | Turn off everything, lock doors |

### 🔔 Notifications

| Automation | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Washing machine done | Power < 5W | Push notification |
| Door left open | Door open > 10 min | Push notification |
