![Smart home security](/images/guides/sikkerhed-hero.png)

Smart home also means responsibility. An insecure setup can give hackers access to your network, cameras, and data. Take security seriously from the start.

<Aside type="danger" title="⚠️ Security is not optional">
Insecure smart home devices are among the most hacked devices on the internet. Many devices have default passwords, no updates, and insecure communication.
</Aside>

## 🔒 Basic Security

### ⭐⭐⭐ Critical (do this first!)

| Action | Why | How |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Strong passwords** | Weak passwords = easy access | Use password manager, 16+ characters |
| **Two-factor on HA** | Extra protection | Settings → Users → 2FA |
| **Update everything** | Security holes get patched | Check for updates weekly |
| **Change default passwords** | Everyone knows them | Router, cameras, everything! |

### ⭐⭐ Recommended

| Action | Why | How |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Separate IoT network** | Isolates devices | VLAN or guest WiFi |
| **Local DNS (Pi-hole)** | Blocks tracking | Run Pi-hole or AdGuard |
| **VPN for remote access** | Secure access from outside | WireGuard, Tailscale |
| **Avoid cloud devices** | Smaller attack surface | Choose local alternatives |

### ⭐ Advanced

| Action | Why | How |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Firewall rules** | Control traffic | pfSense, OPNsense |
| **IDS/IPS** | Detect attacks | Suricata, Snort |
| **Log analysis** | Detect misuse | Graylog, Grafana |

## 🏠 Why Local?

Home Assistant and ESPHome run **locally** on your network. This is a BIG security advantage:

| Local | Cloud |
|-------|-------|
| ✅ Works without internet | ❌ Requires internet |
| ✅ Faster response | ❌ Slower |
| ✅ Private - no data to vendor | ❌ Your data sent to cloud |
| ✅ Works if company shuts down | ❌ Stops if service is discontinued |
| ✅ You have full control | ❌ Vendor has control |

<Aside type="tip" title="Local first">
Always choose local solutions when possible. Zigbee, Z-Wave, and WiFi devices with local API (Tasmota, ESPHome) are better than cloud-dependent devices.
</Aside>

## 🌐 Network Segmentation

Keep IoT devices on a separate network:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     ROUTER                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │                    │                  │
   ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐        ┌────┴────┐
   │  VLAN 1 │         │  VLAN 2 │        │  VLAN 3 │
   │ Primary │         │   IoT   │        │  Guest  │
   │         │         │         │        │         │
   │ PC      │         │ Sensors │        │ Guests  │
   │ Phone   │   ──►   │ Cameras │        │         │
   │ HA      │         │ Bulbs   │        │         │
   └─────────┘         └─────────┘        └─────────┘
```

<Aside type="note" title="Simple solution">
Don't have VLAN support? Use your router's **guest network** for IoT devices. That provides basic isolation.
</Aside>

## 🔐 Password Best Practices

### Good Passwords

```
❌ Bad:    password123
❌ Bad:    MyDog2024
❌ Bad:    qwerty
✅ Good:   correct-horse-battery-staple
✅ Good:   Xk9#mP2$vL8@nQ4&
```

### Use a Password Manager

| Manager | Price | Comment |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Bitwarden** | Free | ⭐ Recommended, open source |
| 1Password | $3/mo | Polished, family sharing |
| KeePass | Free | Offline, full control |

## 🌍 Secure Remote Access

Want to access Home Assistant from outside? Do it securely:

| Method | Security | Difficulty |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Nabu Casa** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Easy |
| **Tailscale VPN** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Easy |
| **WireGuard VPN** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium |
| Reverse proxy + cert | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Hard |
| Port forwarding | ⭐ | **AVOID!** |

<Aside type="danger" title="Never port forward!">
Port forwarding Home Assistant directly to the internet is **extremely dangerous**. Use VPN or Nabu Casa instead.
</Aside>
